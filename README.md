Six specialized AI agents working in harmony:

1. **Ingestion Agent** - Multi-source alert collection with deduplication
2. **Triage Agent** - Intelligent alert prioritization and initial classification  
3. **Analysis Agent** - Deep threat investigation using ReAct reasoning loops
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Structured analyst collaboration and escalation
5. **Response Agent** - Automated containment and remediation actions
6. **Learning Agent** - Continuous model improvement and knowledge extraction

### Tool Orchestration Layer
Unified interface to security tools:
